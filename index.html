        <h2>Don't post text as a image</h2>
        <h2>See why</h2>
        <p>
            Taking a screenshot of your code, terminal, errors or anything fundamentally text-based is counter-productive for everyone involved. The reasons for this are listed below: 
        </p>
        <ul class="code-box">
            <li>
                <h1>People can't copy it</h1>
                <p>
                    When you managed to solve your problem, other users can't rob your code.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h1>Cannot be indexed</h1>
                <p>
                    Images cannot be indexed in search engines. So you will not give ad money to the omp devs xd
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h1>Obscures important information.</h1>
                <p>
                    People can't see your full code, so they can't rob it.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h1>Potentially more expensive.</h1>
                <p>
                    Remember: Some users have a shitty internet speed, so they can't see your image, so they can't help you.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="code-boxes-prop">
            <br />
                <h1>How do i post code properly?</h1>
                <p>
                    Discord use a <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a> system as the preferred formatting language: 
                </p>
                <pre>
    ```<span style="color: #008800;">cpp</span>
    <span style="color: #0000DD;">public</span> OnPlayerConnect(playerid) {
    <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">print</span>(<span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;Hello world&quot;</span>);
    <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">return</span> <span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">1</span>;
}
</pre></div>
        <p>
            Hopefully this has been informative. Now whenever you're helping someone and they share an image of their code or error messages, help them anyway but direct them here so they don't make the same mistake next time!
